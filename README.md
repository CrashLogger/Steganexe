# Steganexe
Stenography software. Not for the regular modern use of stenography, instead, it encodes messages onto images by replacing pixels' colors with character bytes. I guess this could be useful for easter eggs and whatnot.

Designed for Windows, steganexe is a simple way to hide small secrets inside of images, lossless compression encoded ones for the most part, that will escape the average viewer's sight.
